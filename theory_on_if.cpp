// Theory on if (Conditional Statement if)

// If devides the process in between True/False

// False = 0, True = 1 (or any other number: 2,3,4,5,6,7)

// Basically the program only checks if a statement is 0(False) and in it's not, it's True


// Conditions are written using conditional operators

// Relational operators:

// < , <= , > , >= , ==, != 

// Also we use logical operators (it will be in the further files on theory)
